# Easyworship_live_to_obs

The aim of this project is to extract informations from the current slide (live) of Easyworship to a file text. This file can be used as an text source in OSB or other streaming software.

I inspire myself from this github project [https://github.com/mikenor/ew2vm.git](https://github.com/mikenor/ew2vm.git) who exports frame title to an other streaming software.
