# Easyworship_live_to_obs

The aim of this project is to extract informations from the current slide (live) of Easyworship to a file text. This file can be used as an text source in OSB or other streaming software.

I inspire myself from this github project [https://github.com/mikenor/ew2vm.git](https://github.com/mikenor/ew2vm.git) who exports frame title to an other streaming software.

> [!WARNING] 
> As Michael Norton says about his project:
> > Because this program is critically dependent on unsupported use of an undocumented proprietary API for its core functionality, it should be considered highly experimental at all times. Please consider supporting [a feature request for an official EasyWorship API](https://support.easyworship.com/support/discussions/topics/6000033648).
>
> This is the same with my project. Please refere to the section [Compatibilities](#compatibilities) to see which version of Easyworship are compatibles or not. If you try with an other version, please contat-me so I can update this list.
